# Aurora Test Template

This is a minimal variation of the Aurora theme intended for testing servers.  All image assets have been removed and replaced with pure CSS styling.

The template displays a red **Test Server** title instead of the original logo and uses a dark grainy background generated entirely with CSS.

Copy this folder into your `templates_twig` directory and select it like any other theme.
