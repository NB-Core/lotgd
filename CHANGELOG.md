## [Unreleased]
### Features
- Enable zlib compression by default.
- Remove legacy settings stub and streamline cron handling.
- Expanded logging: game log entries can include account IDs, user management and module lifecycle actions, and anonymous entries show a system label.
- Account cleanup now runs inside a database transaction for safer deletions.
- Mail delivery helpers expose PHPMailer error details so admin tools can surface actionable diagnostics.
- Add "Test SMTP settings" action to `configuration.php` to send a diagnostics email.


### Bug Fixes
- Guard against missing city and theme parameters and ensure `diddamage` defaults to zero.
- Use safe array access for player name lookup and tighten module migration checks.
- Preserve the `Settings` singleton when loading extended settings or templates.
- Roll back character cleanup when skipped and log deletions only after commit.
- Add unsuspend buff wrappers and seed default navigation for new characters.
- Normalize withdraw log category to lowercase.
- Show system label for anonymous gamelog entries and record account IDs in maintenance logs.
- Show "Deleted User" placeholder when reading mail from deleted accounts instead of erroring.
- Extend the template preference cookie to one year to prevent theme resets.
- Cast equipment editor and hidden field values to strings to avoid PHP type errors on listings.


### Refactor

- Remove redundant battle buff wrappers.


### Docs

## [2.0.0-rc12] â€“ 2025-09-06

### Dev / Tooling Enhancements
- Integrated **PHPStan** static analysis into the development workflow. Pulling in `phpstan/phpstan`, including configuration for Doctrine and PHPUnit extensions to ensure cleaner, more maintainable code.
- Added **Psalm** alongside PHPStan for additional static type coverage and complementary error detection.
- Enhanced CI pipeline with linting, PHPStan, Psalm, and PHPUnit; enabling pre-commit and GitHub Actions support for rapid feedback and code quality enforcement.
- Configured IDE integration (e.g., PhpStorm) to run Psalm/PHPStan on the fly, enabling real-time editor warnings and fixes. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### Bug Fixes & Minor Improvements
- Addressed minor issues discovered via static analyzers â€” cleaned up undefined variable notices, type-stability warnings, and optimized function signatures.
- Fixed legacy annotation compatibility in comments (`@psalm-` and `@phpstan-`) to avoid tool conflicts. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Summary
These enhancements significantly improve code quality, developer trust, and long-term maintainabilityâ€”while preserving the legacy engine compatibility.
