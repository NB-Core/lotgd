$output->output("`@To get chicks.`n");
$output->output("Seriously, though. The purpose is to slay the green dragon.`n`n");
$output->output("`^2. How do I find the green dragon?`n");
$output->output("`@You can't.`n");
$output->output("Well, sort of.");
$output->output("You can't find her until you've reached a certain level.");
$output->output("When you're at that level, it will be immediately obvious.`n`n");
$output->output("`^3. How do I increase my level?`n");
$output->output("`@Send us money.`n");
$output->output("No, don't send money - you increase your experience by fighting creatures in the forest.");
$output->output("Once you've gotten enough experience, you can challenge your master in the village.`n`n");
$output->output("Well, you can send us money if you want (see PayPal link).`n`n");
$output->output("`^4. Why can't I beat my master?`n");
$output->output("`@He's far too wily for the likes of you.`n");
$output->output("Did you ask him if you have enough experience?`n");
$output->output("Have you tried purchasing some armor or weapons in the village?`n`n");
$output->output("`^5. I used up all my turns. How do I get more?`n");
$output->output("`@Send money.`n");
$output->output("No, put your wallet away.");
$output->output("There *are* a few ways to get an extra turn or two, but by and large you just have to wait for tomorrow.");
$output->output("When a new day comes you'll have more energy.`n");
$output->output("Don't bother asking us what those few ways are - some things are fun to find on your own.`n`n");
$output->output("`^6. When does a new day start?`n");
$output->output("`@Right after the old one ends.`n`n");
$output->output("`^7. Arghhh, you guys are killing me with your smart answers - can't you just give me a straight answer?`n");
$output->output("`@Nope.`n");
$output->output("Well, okay, new days correspond with the clock in the village (can also be viewed from other places).");
$output->output("When the clock strikes midnight, expect a new day to begin.");

$output->output("`^8. Something's gone wrong!!!  How do I let you know?`n");
$output->output("`@Send money.");
$output->output("Better yet, send a petition.");
$output->output("A petition should not say 'this doesn't work' or 'I'm broken' or 'I can't log in' or 'yo.  Sup?'");
$output->output("A petition *should* be very complete in describing *what* doesn't work.");
$output->output("Please tell us what happened, what the error message is (copy and paste is your friend), when it occurred, and anything else that may be helpful.");
$output->output("\"`#I'm broken`@\" is not helpful.");
$output->output("\"`#There are salmon flying out of my monitor when I log in`@\" is much more descriptive as well as humorous, although there's not much we can do about it.");
$output->output("In general, please be patient with these requests - many people play the game, and as long as the admin is swamped with 'yo - Sup?' petitions, it will take some time to sift through them.`n`n");
$output->output("`^9. What if all I have to say is 'yo - sup?'?`n");
$output->output("`@If you don't have something nice (or useful, or interesting, or creative that adds to the general revelry of the game) to say, don't say anything.`n");

$output->output("`@Eat funny mushrooms.`n");
$output->output("No, put that mushroom away, colors are given out by a site's admin for a variety of reasons -- for example it might signify that the character was integral to the beta-testing process - finding a bug, helping to create creatures, etc, or being married to the admin (*cough*Appleshiner*cough*).");
$output->output("Check with your admins to find out how they grant colors.`n`n");
$output->output("`^13. Sup dOOd, iz it cool 2 uz common IM wurds in the village? Cuz u no, it's faster. R u down wit that?`n");

$output->output("Seriously, a wise man once said, \"`#Good things come to those who wait.`@\"");
$output->output("This should also be applied to the Rock.`n`n");
$output->output("`^15. Wow, there are mounts AND familiars in the stables! Can I have one of each?`n");
$output->output("`@(Oh for the love of... [we get this question a lot])`n");
$output->output("No! Not! Nix! Nada! You can only have one creature at a time.");
$output->output("Not two. Certainly not three. Four is right out. Five? You must be joking!");
$output->output("Now all together now, HOW many companion creatures can you have at a time?`n`n");
$output->output("`^16. Why not?`n");

$output->output("The fact is that because there's so many people, there can be several conversations happening at once in any given area.");
$output->output("Also, the thing to understand is that not all the comments are posted immediately, and that sometimes a person won't press the refresh or add button for several minutes, during which time more comments could have been said that the person missed while they were typing their own.");
