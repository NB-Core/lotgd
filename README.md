[![CI](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
This is a fork of the original Legend of the Green Dragon game by Eric "MightyE" Stevens (http://www.mightye.org) and JT "Kendaer" Traub (http://www.dragoncat.net)

The original readme and license texts follow below, also the installation + upgrade routines which haven't changed much.

**Note:** The `CHANGELOG.txt` file does not cover every change. Around 300 commits were made without entries, so refer to the git history for a complete list.

This fork updates the Dragonprime 1.1.1 release with modern tooling while remaining compatible with existing modules. It aims to provide a smoother experience on current PHP versions.  The source lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd) where you can follow development and open issues.

Features of this fork include:
- additional hooks
- a stat system with strength, dexterity, and other attributes
- numerous other changes documented in `CHANGELOG.txt`
- compatibility with PHP 8.3
- PHPMailer replacing the sendmail system
- mail notifications that auto-refresh via Ajax
- incremental chat updates via `commentary_refresh` to load new messages without reloading the page
- Ajax requests are rate limited to roughly one per second; faster requests
  receive an HTTP 429 response. Adjust $ajax_rate_limit_seconds in
  `ext/ajax_settings.php` to change the threshold
- Composer integration for third-party modules
  - after modifying Composer settings, run `composer dump-autoload` to recognize new namespaces
  - after running `composer install` or `composer dump-autoload`, include `autoload.php` to load all dependencies
  - `autoload.php` automatically loads `vendor/autoload.php` and registers the project namespace
- mysqli is now the default database layer
- Twig is now the default template system located in `templates_twig/` (classic `.htm` files continue to work)

It should run on any modern PHP environment. Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd/issues) with questions.

## Read Me First

Thank you for downloading the modified version of Legend Of the Green Dragon.
See `CHANGELOG.txt` for a list of changes.

## System Requirements

To run Legend of the Green Dragon on a typical web host you will need:

- **Web server:** Apache 2 (or another server capable of running PHP)
- **PHP:** version 8.3 or newer
- **Database:** MySQL 5.0 or later. MariaDB is a compatible alternative.
- The database user must have the `LOCK TABLES` privilege.

## Quick Install

Want to have this running in no time?

- Requirements: Apache 2 (or another web server), PHP 8.3 or higher, and MySQL 5.0+ or MariaDB. Ensure the database user has the `LOCK TABLES` privilege.
- Upload the files with the directory structure intact.
- Run `installer.php` in your browser and follow the installer.
- If unsure about features you can activate them later.

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd.git`
2. Start the containers using `docker-compose up -d`.
   The Docker build uses a Composer stage to install PHP dependencies automatically.
3. Run `composer install` to fetch all dependencies, including Doctrine
   Annotations. If you prefer installing packages manually, run
   `composer require doctrine/annotations` instead.
4. Instantiate the entity manager with `Lotgd\Doctrine\Bootstrap::getEntityManager()`
   or include `config/doctrine.php` when using Doctrine CLI tools.

Account changes are flushed through Doctrine's EntityManager when calling
`Lotgd\Accounts::saveUser()`. The `$session['user']` array remains available for
legacy code. Run `composer test` to verify the setup works as expected.

## Twig Templates

Twig templates reside in the `templates_twig/` directory. Each template should
have its own folder containing a `config.json`, `page.twig`, and `popup.twig`.
The distribution includes the **aurora** template and uses it as the default
skin. You can switch to another template by changing the `defaultskin` setting
or by setting a `template` cookie. If a matching folder is found, pages are
rendered with Twig; classic `.htm` templates continue to work as before.
Twig views receive variables for common placeholders like `nav`, `stats`, and
`paypal`, allowing flexible layouts.
Compiled Twig templates are cached under the directory defined by the
`datacachepath` setting. The engine attempts to create a `twig` subdirectory
and only enables caching when it is writable. If the path cannot be created
or written to, templates are rendered without caching.

`dbconnect.php` is created by the installer and stores database and cache
settings in plain PHP.  After installation you can edit this file to point the
`datacachepath` setting at a writable directory:

```php
$DB_USEDATACACHE  = 1;
$DB_DATACACHEPATH = "/path/to/lotgd/data/cache"; // without trailing slash
```

Common locations include a `data/cache` folder within the project or a
dedicated directory such as `/tmp/lotgd`. Give the web server write access
with a command like `chmod 775 data/cache` (or adjust as required by your
hosting environment). A valid `datacachepath` enables Twig cachingâ€”without it
pages must be recompiled and the game runs noticeably slower.

## Install from Release Archive

Official releases include the `vendor/` directory so no additional commands are
required. Download `lotgd-<version>.tar.gz` or `lotgd-<version>.zip` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd/releases) page, upload the contents
to your web server and open `installer.php` in your browser. The installer
will guide you through the setup.

## Release Workflow

Releases are created automatically when pushing a tag that starts with `v`.
Update the version in `common.php`, commit the change and push a tag like
`v2.0.0` or `v2.0.0-rc1`. GitHub Actions then builds archives that contain the
application and its `vendor/` dependencies while omitting development files such
as the `tests/` directory.

## Cron Job Setup

`cron.php` handles automated tasks such as new day resets. It runs from the command line and reads `settings.php` to determine the game directory.
Edit `$GAME_DIR` in `settings.php` to the absolute path of your installation before creating the cron job.  Modules like namecolor/namechange no longer work; set `playername` instead.

## SMTP Mail Setup

LOTGD uses **PHPMailer** for all outgoing mail. Open the admin settings (or edit
`config/configuration.php`) and fill in the options under **SMTP Mail Settings**:

```php
"gamemailhost"       => "SMTP Hostname",
"gamailsmtpauth"    => "SMTP Auth, bool",
"gamemailusername"   => "SMTP Username",
"gamemailpassword"   => "SMTP Password",
"gamemailsmtpsecure" => "SMTP Secure mechanism, enum: [starttls, STARTTLS, tls, TLS]",
"gamemailsmtpport"   => "SMTP port to use,int",
```

Enable `notify_on_warn` or `notify_on_error` and set `notify_address` in the
**Error Notification** section to receive site warnings or errors via email.
These notifications rely on the data cache, so ensure `$DB_USEDATACACHE` is set
to `1` and `$DB_DATACACHEPATH` points to a writable directory in
`dbconnect.php`.

## Beta Setup

`pavilion.php` is an optional script used when beta features are enabled per
player. Players flagged for beta access see a link to the pavilion in the
village and can use it to try experimental features. The repository provides a
minimal template for this file which simply displays a message and a commentary
section. Customize it to implement your own beta content.

## After Upgrading

After upgrading from versions prior to **1.1.1 DP Edition** you should:

- Check your races and remove any `charstats` hooks that only output the race under Vital Info.
- Users with data cache enabled must edit `dbconnect.php` and add:

```php
$DB_USEDATACACHE = 1;
$DB_DATACACHEPATH = "/your/caching/dir"; // without trailing slash
```

- Translators should replace hard coded names in dialogues with `%s` using the Translation Wizard.
- Verify that the server supported languages are configured correctly.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the LOTGD repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd.git
cd lotgd
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Docker Environment

This repository already includes the essential Docker and configuration files. Review these files and adjust them as needed:

1. **Dockerfile**
2. **docker-compose.yml**
3. **.env**
4. **.htaccess**

The details of each file are covered in the [Configuration Files](#configuration-files) section.

### Step 3: Build and Start the Containers

    && echo "error_log = /dev/stderr;" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php.ini

CMD ["apache2-foreground"]
```

### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - lotgd-network

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE}
      MYSQL_USER: ${MYSQL_USER}
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - lotgd-network

volumes:
  db_data:

networks:
  lotgd-network:
```

### .env File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
MYSQL_DATABASE=lotgd
MYSQL_USER=lotgduser
MYSQL_PASSWORD=lotgdpass
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass
```

> **Note:** Change these default passwords for production use.

### .htaccess

The root `.htaccess` file configures custom error pages, disables directory listings, protects sensitive files, and blocks the `install/` folder when `index.php` is removed. Nginx equivalents are provided as comments in that file.

---

## Notes

### Port Configuration

- The container exposes **port 80**. Ensure this port is available on your host machine.
- For production use, you should employ a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) and configure SSL/TLS.

### SSL/TLS

- The current configuration **does not support SSL/TLS**.
- **SSL/TLS must be configured separately**, especially for production environments.
- Consider using Let's Encrypt or another certificate provider.

### Persistent Volumes

- The `db_data` volume ensures that database data is stored persistently.
- **Adjusting Volumes:**
  - Modify the volumes in `docker-compose.yml` as needed.
  - Consider using named volumes or mounting a host directory for backups.

### Security

- **Change Passwords:** Update the default passwords in the `.env` file.
- **Access Rights:** Ensure that sensitive files are not publicly accessible.
- **Updates:** Keep your Docker images and dependencies up to date.
- **Firewall:** Configure your firewall appropriately to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## Useful Commands

- **Stop Containers:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **Restart Containers:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose restart
  ```

- **View Logs:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```

- **Access the Web Container:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose exec web bash
  ```

- **Access the Database Container:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose exec db bash
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Web Container Fails to Start:**
  - Check logs with `docker-compose logs web`.
  - Ensure the base image is correct (`php:8.1-apache`).

- **Database Connection Fails:**
  - Verify that the environment variables in the `.env` file are correct.
  - Check the database settings in your application.

- **Code Changes Not Reflected:**
  - Ensure you have rebuilt the container after making changes to the Dockerfile.
  - Clear your application's cache or your browser's cache if necessary.
- **Installer Log Location:**
  - The installer writes to `install/errors/install.log`. If you see a warning
    that the log could not be written, ensure this path is writable.

- **Ubuntu Private /tmp notice:**
  - On some Ubuntu systems `systemd` isolates the `/tmp` directory for the
    web server. If PHP has `display_errors` enabled, warnings about writing
    temporary files may be output directly to the browser and interrupt the
    installer. Set `display_errors = Off` in your PHP configuration (typically
    located at `/etc/php/<version>/apache2/php.ini`) when this happens. After
    making this change, restart your web server (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart apache2`)
    so the installer and game can run correctly.

### Where to find installer logs

Installer errors are saved to `install/errors/install.log`. Check this file if
the installer fails or reports problems.
