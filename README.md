[![CI](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
This is a fork of the original Legend of the Green Dragon game by Eric "MightyE" Stevens (http://www.mightye.org) and JT "Kendaer" Traub (http://www.dragoncat.net)

The original readme and license texts follow below, also the installation + upgrade routines which haven't changed much.

**Note:** The `CHANGELOG.txt` file does not cover every change. Around 300 commits were made without entries, so refer to the git history for a complete list.

This fork updates the Dragonprime 1.1.1 release with modern tooling while remaining compatible with existing modules. It aims to provide a smoother experience on current PHP versions.  The source lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd) where you can follow development and open issues.

Features of this fork include:
- additional hooks
- a stat system with strength, dexterity, and other attributes
- numerous other changes documented in `CHANGELOG.txt`
- compatibility with PHP 8.3
- PHPMailer replacing the sendmail system
- mail notifications that auto-refresh via Ajax
- incremental chat updates via `commentary_refresh` to load new messages without reloading the page
- Ajax requests are rate limited to roughly one per second; faster requests
  receive an HTTP 429 response. Adjust $ajax_rate_limit_seconds in
  `ext/ajax_settings.php` to change the threshold
- Composer integration for third-party modules
  - after modifying Composer settings, run `composer dump-autoload` to recognize new namespaces
  - after running `composer install` or `composer dump-autoload`, include `autoload.php` to load all dependencies
  - `autoload.php` automatically loads `vendor/autoload.php` and registers the project namespace
- mysqli is now the default database layer
- Twig is now the default template system located in `templates_twig/` (classic `.htm` files continue to work)

It should run on any modern PHP environment. Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd/issues) with questions.

## Read Me First

Thank you for downloading the modified version of Legend Of the Green Dragon.
See `CHANGELOG.txt` for a list of changes.

## System Requirements

To run Legend of the Green Dragon on a typical web host you will need:

- **Web server:** Apache 2 (or another server capable of running PHP)
- **PHP:** version 8.3 or newer
- **Database:** MySQL 5.0 or later. MariaDB is a compatible alternative.
- The database user must have the `LOCK TABLES` privilege.

## Quick Install

Want to have this running in no time?

- Requirements: Apache 2 (or another web server), PHP 8.3 or higher, and MySQL 5.0+ or MariaDB. Ensure the database user has the `LOCK TABLES` privilege.
- Upload the files with the directory structure intact.
- Run `installer.php` in your browser and follow the installer.
- If unsure about features you can activate them later.

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd.git`
2. Start the containers using `docker-compose up -d`.
   The Docker build uses a Composer stage to install PHP dependencies automatically.
3. Run `composer install` to fetch all dependencies, including Doctrine
   Annotations. If you prefer installing packages manually, run
   `composer require doctrine/annotations` instead.
4. Instantiate the entity manager with `Lotgd\Doctrine\Bootstrap::getEntityManager()`
   or include `config/doctrine.php` when using Doctrine CLI tools.

Account changes are flushed through Doctrine's EntityManager when calling
`Lotgd\Accounts::saveUser()`. The `$session['user']` array remains available for
legacy code. Run `composer test` to verify the setup works as expected.

## Twig Templates

Twig templates reside in the `templates_twig/` directory. Each template should
have its own folder containing a `config.json`, `page.twig`, and `popup.twig`.
The distribution includes the **aurora** template and uses it as the default
skin. You can switch to another template by changing the `defaultskin` setting
or by setting a `template` cookie. If a matching folder is found, pages are
rendered with Twig; classic `.htm` templates continue to work as before.
Twig views receive variables for common placeholders like `nav`, `stats`, and
`paypal`, allowing flexible layouts.
Compiled Twig templates are cached under the directory defined by the
`datacachepath` setting. The engine attempts to create a `twig` subdirectory
and only enables caching when it is writable. If the path cannot be created
or written to, templates are rendered without caching.

`dbconnect.php` is created by the installer and stores database and cache
settings in plain PHP.  After installation you can edit this file to point the
`datacachepath` setting at a writable directory:

```php
$DB_USEDATACACHE  = 1;
$DB_DATACACHEPATH = "/path/to/lotgd/data/cache"; // without trailing slash
```

Common locations include a `data/cache` folder within the project or a
dedicated directory such as `/tmp/lotgd`. Give the web server write access
with a command like `chmod 775 data/cache` (or adjust as required by your
hosting environment). A valid `datacachepath` enables Twig cachingâ€”without it
pages must be recompiled and the game runs noticeably slower.

## Install from Release Archive

Official releases include the `vendor/` directory so no additional commands are
required. Download `lotgd-<version>.tar.gz` or `lotgd-<version>.zip` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd/releases) page, upload the contents
to your web server and open `installer.php` in your browser. The installer
will guide you through the setup.

## Release Workflow

Releases are created automatically when pushing a tag that starts with `v`.
Update the version in `common.php`, commit the change and push a tag like
`v2.0.0` or `v2.0.0-rc1`. GitHub Actions then builds archives that contain the
application and its `vendor/` dependencies while omitting development files such
as the `tests/` directory.

## Cron Job Setup

`cron.php` handles automated tasks such as new day resets. It runs from the command line and reads `settings.php` to determine the game directory.
Edit `$GAME_DIR` in `settings.php` to the absolute path of your installation before creating the cron job.  Modules like namecolor/namechange no longer work; set `playername` instead.

## SMTP Mail Setup

LOTGD uses **PHPMailer** for all outgoing mail. Open the admin settings (or edit
`config/configuration.php`) and fill in the options under **SMTP Mail Settings**:

```php
"gamemailhost"       => "SMTP Hostname",
"gamailsmtpauth"    => "SMTP Auth, bool",
"gamemailusername"   => "SMTP Username",
"gamemailpassword"   => "SMTP Password",
"gamemailsmtpsecure" => "SMTP Secure mechanism, enum: [starttls, STARTTLS, tls, TLS]",
"gamemailsmtpport"   => "SMTP port to use,int",
```

Enable `notify_on_warn` or `notify_on_error` and set `notify_address` in the
**Error Notification** section to receive site warnings or errors via email.
These notifications rely on the data cache, so ensure `$DB_USEDATACACHE` is set
to `1` and `$DB_DATACACHEPATH` points to a writable directory in
`dbconnect.php`.

## Beta Setup

`pavilion.php` is an optional script used when beta features are enabled per
player. Players flagged for beta access see a link to the pavilion in the
village and can use it to try experimental features. The repository provides a
minimal template for this file which simply displays a message and a commentary
section. Customize it to implement your own beta content.

## After Upgrading

After upgrading from versions prior to **1.1.1 DP Edition** you should:

- Check your races and remove any `charstats` hooks that only output the race under Vital Info.
- Users with data cache enabled must edit `dbconnect.php` and add:

```php
$DB_USEDATACACHE = 1;
$DB_DATACACHEPATH = "/your/caching/dir"; // without trailing slash
```

- Translators should replace hard coded names in dialogues with `%s` using the Translation Wizard.
- Verify that the server supported languages are configured correctly.

# Legend of the Green Dragon
by  Eric "MightyE" Stevens (http://www.mightye.org)
and JT "Kendaer" Traub (http://www.dragoncat.net)

Modification AND Support Community Page:
http://dragonprime.net

Primary game servers:
http://lotgd.net
http://logd.dragoncat.net

For a new installation, see INSTALLATION below.
For upgrading a new installation, see UPGRADING below.
If you have problems, please visit Dragonprime at the address above.


## UPGRADING

Always back up your database and existing source files before upgrading.

1. Copy the new code into your site directory, replacing the old files.
2. Log out of the game if it is running.
3. Open `installer.php` in your browser and choose **Upgrade**.
4. Follow the installer steps to migrate your database.

If you are upgrading from **0.9.7** or earlier, move the deprecated
`specials` directory aside and convert those scripts to modules.

After the upgrade completes, read the [Post Installation](#post-installation)
section to verify your configuration.


## INSTALLATION:

These instructions cover a new LoGD installation.
You will need access to a MySQL database and a PHP hosting
location to run this game. Your SQL user needs the LOCK TABLES
privilege in order to run the game correctly.

Extract the files into the directory where you will want the code to live.

BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, read and understand the license that this game is
released under.  You are legally bound by the license if you install this
game on a publicly accessible web server!

MySQL Setup:
Setup should be pretty straightforward, create the database, create
an account to access the database on behalf of the site; this account 
should have full permissions on the database.

After you have the database created, point your browser at the location you
have the logd files installed at and load up installer.php (for instance,
if the files are accessible as http://logd.dragoncat.net, you will want to
load http://logd.dragoncat.net/installer.php in the browser).  The installer
will walk you through a complete setup from the ground up.  Make sure to
follow all instructions!

Once you have completed the installation, read the POST INSTALLATION section
below.



# POST INSTALLATION:

Now that you have the game installed, you need to take a couple of sensible
precautions.

Firstly, make SURE that your dbconnect.php is not writeable.  Under unix,
you do this by typing
   chmod -w dbconnect.php
This is to keep you from making unintentional changes to this file.
The installer attempts to remove `installer.php` after installation. If this file remains, delete it to prevent accidental reuse. An `.htaccess` file in the `install/` directory (and the root `.htaccess`) deny access when that file is gone. You may remove the entire `install/` folder once setup is complete.


The installer will have installed, but not activated, some common modules
which we feel make for a good baseline of the game.

You should log into the game (using the admin account created during
installation if this is a new install, or your regular admin account if this
is an update) and go into the manage modules section of the Superuser Grotto.
Go through the installed and uninstalled modules and make sure that the
modules you want are installed.  Do NOT activate them yet.
*** NOTE *** If this is a first-time install, you will see some messages about
races and specials not being installed during your character setup.  This is
fine and correct since you have not yet configured these items.

Now, go to the game settings page, and configure the game settings for the
base game and for the modules.   For an update, this should be just a
matter of looking at the non-active (grey-ed out) modules.  For an initial
install, this is a LOT of configuration, but taking your time here will
make your game MUCH better.

If you are upgrading from 0.9.7, look at your old game settings and make
the new ones similar.  A *lot* of settings have moved from the old
configuration screen and are now controlled by modules, so you will want
to write down your old configuration values BEFORE you start the upgrade.

Once you have things configured to your liking, you should go back to the
manage modules page and ACTIVATE any modules that you want to have running.

Good luck and enjoy your new LotGD server!

## Composer Local Setup

Optional Composer packages can be defined in
`config/composer.local.json`. Copy the provided
`config/composer.local.json.dist` to this location and run
`composer update` to install the additional dependencies. The
`composer-merge-plugin` will automatically merge the local file with the
main `composer.json`.

# LOTGD Docker Environment

This guide explains how to containerize and run the LOTGD application using Docker. The provided Docker environment is configured for development and testing purposes. Additional configurations are required for production use, particularly regarding security and SSL encryption.

```

### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - lotgd-network

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE}
      MYSQL_USER: ${MYSQL_USER}
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - lotgd-network

volumes:
  db_data:

networks:
  lotgd-network:
```

### .env File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
MYSQL_DATABASE=lotgd
MYSQL_USER=lotgduser
MYSQL_PASSWORD=lotgdpass
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass
```

> **Note:** Change these default passwords for production use.

### .htaccess

The root `.htaccess` file configures custom error pages, disables directory listings, protects sensitive files, and blocks the `install/` folder when `index.php` is removed. Nginx equivalents are provided as comments in that file.

---

## Notes

### Port Configuration

- The container exposes **port 80**. Ensure this port is available on your host machine.
- For production use, you should employ a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) and configure SSL/TLS.

### SSL/TLS

- The current configuration **does not support SSL/TLS**.
- **SSL/TLS must be configured separately**, especially for production environments.
- Consider using Let's Encrypt or another certificate provider.

### Persistent Volumes

- The `db_data` volume ensures that database data is stored persistently.
- **Adjusting Volumes:**
  - Modify the volumes in `docker-compose.yml` as needed.
  - Consider using named volumes or mounting a host directory for backups.

### Security

- **Change Passwords:** Update the default passwords in the `.env` file.
- **Access Rights:** Ensure that sensitive files are not publicly accessible.
- **Updates:** Keep your Docker images and dependencies up to date.
- **Firewall:** Configure your firewall appropriately to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## Useful Commands

- **Stop Containers:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **Restart Containers:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose restart
  ```

- **View Logs:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```

- **Access the Web Container:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose exec web bash
  ```

- **Access the Database Container:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose exec db bash
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Web Container Fails to Start:**
  - Check logs with `docker-compose logs web`.
  - Ensure the base image is correct (`php:8.1-apache`).

- **Database Connection Fails:**
  - Verify that the environment variables in the `.env` file are correct.
  - Check the database settings in your application.

- **Code Changes Not Reflected:**
  - Ensure you have rebuilt the container after making changes to the Dockerfile.
  - Clear your application's cache or your browser's cache if necessary.
- **Installer Log Location:**
  - The installer writes to `install/errors/install.log`. If you see a warning
    that the log could not be written, ensure this path is writable.

- **Ubuntu Private /tmp notice:**
  - On some Ubuntu systems `systemd` isolates the `/tmp` directory for the
    web server. If PHP has `display_errors` enabled, warnings about writing
    temporary files may be output directly to the browser and interrupt the
    installer. Set `display_errors = Off` in your PHP configuration (typically
    located at `/etc/php/<version>/apache2/php.ini`) when this happens. After
    making this change, restart your web server (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart apache2`)
    so the installer and game can run correctly.

### Where to find installer logs

Installer errors are saved to `install/errors/install.log`. Check this file if
the installer fails or reports problems.
